![GitHub release](https://img.shields.io/badge/Download%20Latest%20Release-Click%20Here-brightgreen?style=flat-square&logo=github)

## Overview

The **Promoter Expression Predictor** is a machine learning pipeline designed to predict gene expression levels from DNA promoter sequences. This tool utilizes k-mer features and ensemble methods to deliver accurate predictions. Built using the robust **scikit-learn** library, it includes comprehensive evaluation and visualization tools to aid researchers in understanding gene expression dynamics.

## Features

- Predicts gene expression levels from DNA promoter sequences.
- Uses k-mer features for effective classification.
- Implements ensemble methods for enhanced accuracy.
- Provides evaluation metrics to assess model performance.
- Includes visualization tools for data analysis and results interpretation.

## Installation

To get started with the Promoter Expression Predictor, clone the repository and install the required dependencies.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/aldyforez/promoter-expression-predictor.git
cd promoter-expression-predictor
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

To use the Promoter Expression Predictor, follow these steps:

1. Prepare your DNA promoter sequence data in a suitable format.
2. Run the main script to initiate the prediction process:

```bash
python main.py --input your_data_file.csv --output results.csv
```

3. Review the results in the output file specified.

For more detailed usage instructions, refer to the documentation within the repository.

## Data

The model requires DNA promoter sequences as input data. Each sequence should be represented in a format compatible with the k-mer feature extraction process. Hereâ€™s a sample structure for the input data:

| Sequence_ID | Promoter_Sequence |
|-------------|--------------------|
| 1           | ATGCGTACGTCG       |
| 2           | GCTAGCTAGCTA       |

Ensure that your dataset is cleaned and preprocessed to avoid errors during the prediction phase.

## Model Training

The pipeline includes a training phase where the model learns from labeled data. The training process involves:

1. **Data Splitting**: Dividing the dataset into training and testing sets.
2. **Feature Extraction**: Extracting k-mer features from the promoter sequences.
3. **Model Selection**: Choosing the best ensemble method for prediction.

The following ensemble methods are implemented:

- Random Forest
- Gradient Boosting
- Voting Classifier

To train the model, execute the training script:

```bash
python train.py --train_data your_training_data.csv
```

## Evaluation Metrics

After training, it is essential to evaluate the model's performance. The following metrics are used:

- **Accuracy**: The ratio of correctly predicted instances to the total instances.
- **Precision**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total predicted positives.
- **Recall**: The ratio of true positive predictions to the total actual positives.
- **F1 Score**: The harmonic mean of precision and recall.

You can find the evaluation results in the output logs generated during the training phase.

## Visualization Tools

Visualization is crucial for interpreting the results. The Promoter Expression Predictor includes several visualization tools:

- **Confusion Matrix**: To visualize the performance of the classification model.
- **ROC Curve**: To assess the trade-off between true positive rate and false positive rate.
- **Feature Importance**: To identify which k-mer features contribute most to the predictions.

Use the following command to generate visualizations:

```bash
python visualize.py --results results.csv
```
